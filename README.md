Project  - When the website is opened login page will be displayed, if new user they can be registered as Mentor/Mentee and for registration, users are supposed to enter their interests/skills and other details and based on that Interest we are matching Mentor with Mentee , so that they can take any help from that Mentee, and after that the mentee is assaigned to a menter and they are redirect to a Telegram group where they discuss anything rellated to their interest. Basically our main idea is that the Mentor/Mentee can be matched based upon their interests and then those Mentors can guide Mentees.
